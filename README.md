****Output****

The tool creates an organized directory structure for results:
<pre lang="bash">
instagram_data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshots/                             # Debug screenshots (if --debug is enabled)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ json_files/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ username_following_TIMESTAMP.json     # People you follow
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ username_followers_TIMESTAMP.json     # People who follow you
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ username_non_followers_TIMESTAMP.json # People who don't follow you back
</pre>

**How It Works**
1. The bot logs into your Instagram account
2. It navigates to your profile and extracts your following and followers lists
3. It compares the lists to identify accounts that don't follow you back
4. Results are saved as JSON files in the output directory

****Advanced Features****

**Normalized Username Comparison**
The tool uses a sophisticated username normalization technique to ensure accurate matching. This catches cases where the same account might appear with slight variations in capitalization or formatting.


**Verification System**
The --verify option performs an additional check on a sample of identified non-followers by directly checking their following list, providing an accuracy percentage.
